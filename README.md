# grundig-button-replacement
I designed replacements for the control panels on old Grundig car radios. These were made for the SAAB radios NyköpingII and Trollhättan II, but will also fit the models these are based on (WCK4870RDS, WKC2841VD) and a bunch of other Grundig and OEM models.
The original design uses rubber contacts - these harden over time and eventually fail. Even NOS replacements fail after a short while. There are no new production rubber contacts.
I redesigned the PCB to be suitable for miniature SMD buttons. These are direct replacements, only very little modification has to be done.
Contact Pins and lamps have to be transfered from the old PCB, and the holes in base of the plastic buttons (where the rubber contacts formerly resided) have to be filled (I used hot glue).
